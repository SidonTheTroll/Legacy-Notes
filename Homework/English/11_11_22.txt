Dear Trollge, 

*Insert Carl Johnson's famous dialogue*. Its the time again for agony because of repeated periods. I don't know why the maths class feels so slow.
Most of the classes today were wasted because most of the students were busy preparing for children's day but I never joined them because I have 
trust issues. Perhaps they are also collecting donations like crazy just like in teacher's day but I am not going to talk about that or else it 
would be controverisal. Since there was no class in the period before recess break, I already finished my lunch 20 minutes and other students 
were calling me a maniac; after that a spend all the time sleeping in the last bench. After the recess break, it was the time again for maths
class and I hate it more than myself and the english syllabus is also way lagging behind. The other two classes after the maths part 2 class 
went just fine but since I was getting bored, I started making lean powder (don't worry its not any illegal stuff). It went as expected without 
any issues. And finally the end of the school was declared and I was free again. Liteally nothing special happened today and it was boring as hell. 
MANKIND IS DEAD. BLOOD IS FUEL. HELL IS FULL.
