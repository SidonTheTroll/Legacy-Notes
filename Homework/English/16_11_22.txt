Dear trollge, 

Yet another tiring day and finally the end of the diary entries. Its been a rough week but I know that its going to get harder since its my final year in the school. Man, 
time really flies by and it just went from Nursery to 10 in 12 years in just a flash. It feels like I was in Nursery few weeks ago. My self learning German lessons are 
going fine and I guess I will go full time learning German after finishing the boards. Perhaps India's as well as most of the country's school system wasn't so dumb and 
homework was non-existant. Sometimes I feel like going back in time and vanishing Henry Fischel and Horase Mann from existence so that I can save the kids in the future. So 
that children would be able to think like a team and be more creative because the world and technology has changed but the school system is the same as it used to be in the 
during the start of the Industrial revolution when the factories wanted more skilled labour. I am not saying that exams are bad; they are essential to filter out the 
candidates and give qualification to the more skilled ones so that there would not be any chaos in the world. Remeber that if this doesn't change soon, I can't assure what 
would happen if we continue preparing children for the future with the system of the past. Because even if children may be just a portion of the population, they are the 
100% of the future.
