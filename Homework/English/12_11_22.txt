Dear Trollge,

Oh danm its the end of the week again. Time surely flies by and I havent eved finished 2 of my homework. I will perhaps do that tomorrow. Because 
attending school is more important. The school's children's day preparation is going on full swing and I wonder how it's going to be on the 
actual day and want something unusual to happen in the fasion show. But too bad I can't make any fun because it's only for the very juniors. 
As usual, the math's class felt more like a speedrun. But I still can't figure out why one of my frined was charged of breaking a girl's bottle 
and she's also such greedy that at first she had an expensive af bottle and and second she asked him to to pay 700 bucks for the compensation. I 
mean really? Is that really the cost of her bottle? I could have brought a nice gay light keyboard with that amount of money. After that, rest 
of the classes went without any teacher and just the Physics class had an actual practical. Rest of the day was passed grinding and doing 
homework. Oh damn I should have made the artwork earlier but I can't stop procrastinating.
