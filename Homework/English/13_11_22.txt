Dear Trollge, 

Its Sunday innit! Oh wait the whole day was passed doing studying, homework and grinding. Hope Ich will finish das homework till the deadline. 
Today was nothing interesting for an introvert like me. Tomorrow's childrens' day and I have prepared to troll people bu doing the fortnite meme 
dance. Oh and my mom was outside when I returned from tuition and I found the door locked so I just picked the lock of the backdoor and she was 
surprised to find me inside of the house and she to me not to rob anyone's house with that skill. Well time to practice the meme dance again to 
troll everyone tomorrow. Oh btw I completed making the Blue Meth and packed it. I hope I would get clients tomorrow.
