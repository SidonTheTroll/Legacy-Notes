Dear Trollge, 

Today's children's day and I was prepared to troll my friends by emoting them but it happened so that the organisers only found our class to 
keep all the chairs and today also had unexpectedly more children so it was quite akward to dance in front of them so I didn't do it. The 
whole program was great but I felt like it was not so organised. Although, I liked the stuff everyone did even though I'm not into that. 
Rest of the day was boring but when it came to the refreshment break, the food was quite decent and after that, I had no other purpose in the 
school so I escaped without anyone suspecting me, yes you saw that right, I quite vented. "Hey man have you heard about the hit game 'Among Us'? 
We have to vent now to meet the funny rock. Isn't that kinda sus?"
