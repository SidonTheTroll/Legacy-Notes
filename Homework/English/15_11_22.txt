Dear Trollge, 

Today was very unexpected that I woke up early which is not very usual and prepared so much that I packed my bag up like 2 hours ago. I didn't 
cared for the message I got last night. I came into my notice that even my parents are saying that the school will be closed. Eh, I guess it 
was time to do the homework again. So I just spend the whole day doing homework and unfortunately, my annoying brother wasted 5 hours of the day 
just consoling him. Heck I didn't even finished doing rest of my homework because I'm getting homework after homework. It feels like a waste of 
time and being bored. Waste of time. That's what I say. Nutzlos und langweilig. Es hat keinen Sinn zu tun.
