When after applying force, and object moves by 1 metre is called 1 joule 

The capacity of doing work is called energy. Unit: Joule 

Kilo-joule is a commercial unit and should not be used  in everyday life 

Mechanical energy: kinetic energy and potential energy 

The energy aquired by an object due to its motion is called kinetic energy   

The energy aquired by an object when it is in rest is called potential energy 

kinetic energy = 1/2 of mass • velocity

Sum of potential and kinetic energy remains constant at any point 




Final velocity² - initial velocity² = 2 • acceleration • displacement 

    => v² - u² = 2as 
    => v² - u²/ 2a = s 

Work done = force • displacement (Force = mass • velocity)

          => mass • acceleration • v² - u²/ 2as (acceleration gets cancelled out)

          => 1/2 mass • (v - u)² (if initial velocity = 0)

    Therefore, Work done = 1/2 of mass times velocity (work = 1/2 • m • v²)

Potential energy = force • distance (or displacement) 

                 => mass • acceleration due to gravity • height (because we are on earth and gravity acts towards the centre)

            Therefore, Potential energy = mass times acceleration due to gravity times height (m • g • h)
