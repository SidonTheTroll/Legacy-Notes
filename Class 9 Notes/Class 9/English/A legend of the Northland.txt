the saint stopped near a shop and asked a piece of cake but the owner was hasitating.

the day was short and the night was long.

when snow fall, they fix the reindeer to their sledes and the children like like bear cubs because they wear furry coats and they look funny.

The poet heard a strange story but the poet didn't believed that.

Saint Peter roamed the whole world to spread his ideology.

the woman was baking cakes.

The saint was very hungry and he asked the woman to give him a single piece of cake.

the woman was very greedy.

the woman made a little cake but as it was baked it grew larger but she didn't want to give the saint so she prepared a smaller cake.

when the second cake was made, it was as larger as the previous one and she didn't want to give it either.

she took a small quantity and made it thin as a wafer because of her greediness.

she stored all the cakes she made int the shelf.

the saint grew angry.

the woman's greediness was enough to provoke saint Peter.

Humans are selfish but the womad doesn't deserve to be a human. 

the saint cursed the woman.

whe waman changed into a bird and flew atop of the chimney.

she was waering a red hat.

every conuntry school boy had seen her in the woods.

this poem is a ballad
