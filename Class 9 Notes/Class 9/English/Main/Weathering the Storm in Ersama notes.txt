The story is written by Harsh Mander 

The Story took place in 1999.

Prashant lived in the village of Kalikuda 

Prashant was 19 years old

Prashant's mother dies in 1992

The costal block of Ersama was 18 km away from Kalikuda 

The storm started in the evening 
 
The flood water was neck deep 

The buildings that were made of bricks and mortar were strong enough to resist the winds. 

The wind speed was 350 kmph

Prashant's friend's family was terrified by the uprooting of the trees which damaged the roofs and walls 

The tusnami continued for 36 hours.

Prashant and his friend's family took shelter in the roof of the house 

The color of the flood water was grey 

The dead body of animals and humans were swelled up by the flood water 

The two coconut trees that had falled on their house came as a blessing in disguise

The rain water had washed away Prashant's tears

Two days seemed to be like 2 years of Prashant

Prashant equiped himself with a long sturdy stick and started his 18 kilometre journey back to his village 

Prashant would never forget the journey back to his village

Prashant had to determine where the water was the most shallow by the stick 

Prashant's and his family's belongings were mangled and twisted in the tree branches 

The progress was slower where the water was waist deep 

He found two friends of his uncle in the middle of the road who were also returning to the village 

Prashant decided to go to the Red Cross shelter to look for his family 

Prashant first saw his maternal grandmother 

Prashant's whole family was alive and took refuge to the Red Cross shelter 

There were 2500 people in the shelter

86 people died and 96 houses were washed away in by the storm 

The people in the shelter were only surviving by green coconuts

Prashant and his group pressurised the merchant to give them rice

The rice was already rotting but the people in the shelter didn't cared 

Prashant's team's next task was to clean the vomit, urine , filth and floating carcasses and tend the wounds and fractures of the victims of the storm 

The military helicopter came by on the fifth day 

The children placed the plates on their bellies 

The women were organised to look after the orphaned children 

The military helicopter air dropped food and other basic needs to the shelter
