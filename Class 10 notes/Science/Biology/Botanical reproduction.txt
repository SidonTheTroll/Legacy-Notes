Reproduction:  Biological process that enables existing organisms to reproduce new organisms (which are similar to the existing)
    • Fundamental attribute of living organisms 
    • Contineuity of species 

Types: Asexual
         • Uniparental 
         • Mitosis
       Sexual
         • Both uniparental and parental 
         • Both mitosis and meiosis 


Lifespan: Period between birth and natural death. (All living organisms are mortal except unicellular organisms)

NOTE: Lifespan is a specific trait for every organism
      Lifespan cannot be co-related with the size/complexity of organisms
      Eg.- Peepal: 2500 years; Banyan: 250 years 
           Crow: 15 years; parrot: 140 years 
           Housefly: 2 weeks; elephant, crocodile, horse: 60 years 


Basic featres of reproduction: Cell division
                               Duplication of cellular apparatus (cell organelles)
                               Formation of reproductive units





Formation of reproductive units: 
  Specialised eg.- zoosporangium, sporangiuum 

  Non-specialised eg.- binary fission 


ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION:

Basic features: 

- Uniparental
- Gameotogenesis may or may not occur.
- Morphologically and genetically identical offsprings (clones)
- Occurs through both specialised and unspecialised cells
- Cell division: mitosis and amitosis (binary fusion)
- Some higher plants also perform vegetative propogation
- Simple and rapid 
- Somatogenesis (small cells develop into body cells)

Parthenocarpy: Fruit formation without fertilisation (seedless fruits)



• Types of asexual reproduction: 

(i) Binary fission
(ii) Spore formation
(iii) Regeneration
(iv) Budding
(v) Fragmentation 
(vi) Vegetative propogation 

(A) Binary fusion: 
    Bacteria: amitosis (binary fusion)
    Eucaryote: Mitosis 

Formation of two daughter cells 

Types: (i) Irregular/simple 
          Eg: Amoeba 

       (ii) Transverse
          Eg: paramecium, diatoms, bacteria 

       (ii) Longitudinal 
          Eg: Euglena, vorticella 
       
       (iv) Oblique: 
          Eg: Einoflagellates 


(B) Budding: 

- Unicellular organisms 
Eg: yeast 

- An outgrowth knows as bud, formed on parent body 

    - Karyokinesis (division of a cell nucleus during mitosis): unequal 
    - Cytokinesis (division of a parent cell which divides the cytoplasm of a parent cell into two daughter cell)



(C) Fragmentation: 

- division of the body into several parts which grow into a full cell 

- Takes place in filamentous algae 
Eg: fungi, hydra, starfish (mechanical injury)



(D) Spore formation: 

-Specialised reproductive units are formed that are known as spores. Eg.- algae, fungi



(E) Regeneration

Morphallaxis: whole body grows from a small part. Eg.- pantaria, starfish, hydra, sponges 

Epimorphosis: Replacement of last part. Eg.- broken tail of lizard 



(F) Vegetative propagation/reproduction

- Detachable vegetative parts/somatic parts (carries compact immature shoot protected by immature leaves (also known as buds))

    • Stem (bud)
    • Roots  -------- Adentitious buds
    • Leaves ----|

Types: 
  (i) Natural 
  (ii) Artificial 

(a) Stem: 
  1. Uderground stem: Non-green, food,storin, perennating structure

  (a) Tuber: Eg.- potato
  (b) Corm: vertical growth unbranched. Eg.- gladiolus, zaminkand 
  (c) Rhizome: horizontal growth, branched stem. Eg.- ginger, banana, ferns. 
    Nodes: scaly leaves 
  (d) Bulb: Reduced, discoid stem. Eg.- onion 


• Sub aerial stem: 

Offset: Aquatic plants. Eg.- Eichhornia

Sucker: Lateral Branches grow obiquely upwards. Eg.- pineapple, banana, aloe vera. etc 

Runners: Elongated prostate branches with long internodes. Eg.- grass 

Stolan: acched, horizontal branches. Eg.- strawberry, jasmine, mint, etc
