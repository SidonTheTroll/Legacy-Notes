Gavin Maxwell (FRSL: Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, FZS: Fellow of Zoological Society, FRGS: Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society) 
He was born on 15 July 1914 and died on 7 September 1969 

He was a Scottish Naturalist and author, best known for his non-fiction writings and his work with otters (small carnivorous animal)

He wrote the book "Ring of Bright water" in 1960 about how he brought an otter from Iraq and raised it in Scotland 






The narrator travelled to Iraq in 1956 

The narrator had a pet dog and the dog died the narrator thought of keeping another pet that is not a dog 

Camusfearna was surrounded by water 

He wanted to keep an animal that can enjoy the water of the place 

Tigris is a river in Iraq 

Tigris marshes have a huge population of otter 

Otters were tamed by the Arabs 

The narrator and his friend were going to Basra to the Consulate-General to collect and answer their mails from Europe 

He and his friend were expecting mails but his friend got the mail first 

The narrator sent a telegram to England and for 3 days, nothing had happened 

After that he decided to call but it had to be booked 24 hours in advance 

On the first day, the line was out of order. On the second day, the exchange was closed because of a religious holiday. On the third day, there was 
another breakdown

As his friend got his letter he decided to leave and he promised to meet him in a week in Scotland

After 5 days, he got his letter 

He took the mail to his bedroom to read it and there were two Arabs were squtting in the floor and beside them layed a sack which moved from time to time 

He couldn't understand what had happened

After that the Arabs handed him a note written, "Here is your otter" and the Arabs handed him the otter 

With the opening of the sack, a new phase of life started

He knew that his phase was going on and until he wanted it to end 

Instead of that he was surprised and wanted to enjoy the company of and otter. 

Only only him who owned an otter, those people also (people who have an otter as a pet) enjoyed its company

When it came out of the sack, the otter looked like a small dragon from the medieval time

The otter was fully covered by mud armour (dried mud) but a small portion can be seen and the color of the otter's fur was visible which was chocolate 
brown colored 

When it (otter) shook itself, the narrator expected that the tile floor would be full of dust but it didn't happened. 

It took one month to clear all the mud from the otter's body 

And after that, he could see the original colors of the otter 

The otter was named Mijbil and it's race was unknown in science 

Zoologists named the otter's race as Lutrogame perspicillata maxwelli or Maxwell's otter 

The otter was neither hostile nor friendly 

It was maintaining a distance from the otter keeping a distance from the narrator's bed 

The second night, Mijbil came to the narrator's bed in the early morning and remained asleep near his knees' back portion until the servant bought tea in
the morning 

And during the day, Mijbil started getting interested about its surrounding 

The narrator made a body belt for it and took it to the bathroom where it enjoyed being in the water for half an hour 

He jumped and rolled in the water jumping up and down and started moving irregularly and splashed the water 

The character of the otter was not familiar to the narrator 

The otter wanted to play with every drop of water 

Whenver the otter saw a bowl, it wanted to overturn it, if it doesn't he sat on it and made it overflow because the Mijbil wanted to make the water
move and whenver, it stayed static (no moving) he got annoyed 

Mijbil escaped the narrator's bedroom as he entered it and he saw his tail around the corridor which led to the bathroom 

When the narrator reached there, Mijbil was playing with the taps with his paws in effort to open them 

He successfully opened the tap on the first day but on other days, he turned the tap the other way which made it tighter 

Mijbil would follow the narrator whenever he called his name 

He would spend hours playing with a rubber ball using all of his feet to dribble it and he can also throw it with a flick of its neck to a surprising 
height and distance 

The real play starts when he lies on his back and juggles small objects between his paws 

Marbles were Mijbil's favourite toys 

He would lie on his back rolling two or more marbles on his wide, flat belly without dropping one to the floor
