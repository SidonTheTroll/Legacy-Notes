Valliammai was called Valli for short and was 8 years old

She had interest to know different things

Her favourite passtime was standing near the front door and look what was going on in the street

She had no playmates in the street the same age as her 

She had nothing to do so she watched what happened in the street 

Watching the street gave her many new unusual experences 

The bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town was the most fascinating for Valli
