Process of arrival and departure of "Fog" in the city and harbour 

Fog is a thick cloud because of tiny droplets of water and usually seen in winter season

The poet has compared to a cat because it comes silently and goes away like a cat

Not only compared with a cat but also to our problems in our life 



Poetic devices: 

    Metaphor: 
        Fog to a cat 

    Rhyme scheme: 
        Free verse 

    Personification: 
        The fog is personified to a cat (fog comes, it sits, and goes away)

    Enjambment: 
        It fog ... cat feet
        It sits .. moves on 

    Transferred epithet: when an adjective is used to described one thing is transferred to another thing 
        On silent haunches: the fog is silent but is used with other word because haunches cannot be silent 
        
            - Eg. a sleeping pillow === sleeping = adjective; pillow = noun 

    Imagery: 
        The fog and cat comes silently and goes away silently 
            - when we read this poem, a beautiful image comes to our mind that the city and harbour are covered with fog and nothing far away is visible to us
