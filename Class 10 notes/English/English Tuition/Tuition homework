Subject: Regarding the domestic violence taking place between aged couples. 

Respected sir, 
        I would like to draw your kind attention towards the problem regarding the violence taking place between aged couples living alone at home. It causes a lot of disturbance and unnecessary violecne in the society. I have also noitced the same issue in nearby societies too. If this remains a problem, the people involved in the violecne may kill each other and vandalise their own property as well as other's. I informed the police about this problem but it appears that they didn't took any action till now. So I though it would be better to inform you, The Editor of Hindustan Times, so that you can print the incidents in the newspaper and the legislative can take the actions immediately. 

Therefore I request you to print this issue in your newspaper so that the police can take actions before the situation becomes worse. 

Thanking you 
Yours faithfully
Sushant
