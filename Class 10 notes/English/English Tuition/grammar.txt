                                Clauses

1 verb: simple sentence
More than 1 verb: complex sentence/complex sentence

• Clause is a group of words containing a verb and a subject. It's a part of a sentence or a sentence by itself.

• At least two parts must be there in a clause. 
• Sometimes the second subject is omitted, it is also a clause  
• When the sentence has two subjects and verbs, it is a clause 100%


• Independent clause: main clause 
• Dependent clause: subordinate cluase 

Independent clause: The clauses that make complete sense on their own are called Independent/main clause. 

Dependent clause: the clauses that cannot make complete sense on their own and depend on the main clause to make their meaning complete are called Dependent/
subordinate clauses. 

Conjunctions required to join the clauses: 
Main clauses are joined by coordinating conjunctions (eg. and, for, or, yet, but, not, so, nor, etc) and corelative conjunction (either, or, neither, nor, etc)

• In a clause the minimum criteria is there should be one main clause and one subordinate clause but there can be more than one main clause and more than one
subordinate clause in a clause 


Connecting two main clauses: 

Eg. Ram is studing and/but Hari is playing. 

For connecting main clauses we use 'and' and 'but'

Connecting a main clause and a subordinate clause:

Subordinate clauses are joined to the main clause by subordinating conjunctions (when, before, though, although, because, etc).

Another way we can connect main and subordinating cluse: subordinating conjunctions and  relative pronouns(who, whom, whose, which, whos, that, etc)

Coordinating conjunction: Coordinating conjunction is a word that joins two elements of equal grammatical rank or importance. They can join two verbs, two adjectives, 
two phrases, two nouns, two Independent clauses 

Coordinating conjunction:

    Seema is cooking and Ravian is serving
    and = coordinating conjunction

Corelative conjunction: corelative conjunctions work in pairs to join words, phrases, clauses. (either, or; neither, nor; not only, but also; whether, or; both, and)

Subordinating conjunction: a subordinating conjunction is a word or phrase that joins a dependent clause to an Independent clause. 

The girl who called me yesterday is my sister 
who = relative pronoun 

coordinating conjunction are used to connect main clauses and corelative conjunction are used to join main clauses or to form compound sentences and subordinating 
conjunctions are used to join subordinating dependent clause to independent clause 


			Types of clauses
			
Noun clause:  a noun clause is used as a noun in a sentence. They act as a subject of a sentence, as an object of the verb, as an object of the preposition, as a compliment. 

Eg. Subject of a sentence: 
-> what he said was interesting 
		was interesting = main clause 
		was= main verb 
		what he said = noun 

Object of the verb: 
-> He asked why I was late. 
		he asked: main clause 
		asked: main verb 
		whay i was late: subordinate clause 
		
Object of the preposition: 
-> I loved at what she had done 
		at: preposition 
		what she had done: object 
		


adjective clause: 
adverb clause 





25/04/22

Clauses: Independent clause, dependent clause 
dependent clause: noun clause, adjective clause, adverb clause 


Eg.- Whenever he travels, he makes new friends.  


Hints to check for the type of clause: 
• A dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun. 

Types of conjunctions: 
(i) Coordinating conjunction: one independent clause with another independent clause 
(ii) Corelative conjunction: one independent clause with another independent clause 
(iii) Subordinating conjunction: independent to dependent clause 
(iv) Relative pronoun: independent to dependent clause 


I like ice cream and my sister likes cold coffee.


================================================================================================================================================================================

Subordinating conjunctions: 
(i) To indicate time: till, until, once, before, after, since, when, while, as long as, as soon as, whenever 
(ii) To indicate condition: if, unless, had, whether or not, provided, when, since, while, 
(iii) To indicate position: where, whererver, everywhere, anywhere
(iv) To indicate reason: because, in case, as much as, since, in so far as, as in case, just, as 
(v) To indicate purpose: so, that, so that, in order, so as to, in case
(vi) To indicate consequence: since, as, therefore, as a result, so that, 
(vii) To indicate contrast: even, though, although, even if, whereas, despite, even though
(viii) To indicate comparision: however, that, yet, still, but, nevertheless, on the other hand. 
(ix) To indicate comparision or manner: like, as , as... as, if, the way, then

================================================================================================================================================================================


• When subordinating conjunctions are used at the middle of a sentence, we do not use a comma but when it is in the initial point, we use a comma.



26/04/22

Why do we use noun clause? 
= When a single noun is not enough to complete the meaning of a sentence, at that time we use noun clause. 


To identify a noun clause:

• Conjunctions: who, whoever, whom, what, whatever, whomever, where, whererver, which, whichever, why, whether, how, that, if. 

• To identify a noun clause just ask 'what'. The answer we get, that is noun clause 

• To confirm if it is a noun clause, we have to replace it with a pronoun. (he, she, that, this, it, you, their, etc)


Noun clauses are placed in a sentence as a subject of a sentence, object of the verb, object of the preposition and as a compliment. 


Subject of a sentence: 
Eg.- How she behaved was very rude. 
		Starts with how
		What behaved very rude? = She behaved very rude.
		'How she behaved?' She/ It/ That behaved very rude. 


• At least a subject and a verb are required to complete a sentence 

• We consider the verb in the main clause as the main verb. 



27/04/22

• Dependent clause starts with a conjunction 


Noun clause as a subject in the sentece:  
Eg.- What you do in your free time is your hobby.    
			'What you do in your free time'= subject 
			'is' = main verb
			'your hobby'= object
		'What' = preposition 
		'What you do in your free time' = What you do in your free time is your hobby. 
		Replace the subject to a pronoun: That/ this/ it is your hobby.
		
Noun clause as an object of the verb: 
Eg.- He did not realise that he had done a mistake. 
				'That': conjunction
				"That he had done a mistake": dependent clause
				"He did not realisesd": main clause 

			What didn't he realise?: He did not realised his mistake. 
			It/ that had done a mistake.
			
Eg. I didn't know why I was going to meet her. 
				'why': conjunction
				"I didn't know": independent clause "Why I was going to meet her.": dependent clause 
				I didn't know that/ it. 



Noun clause as an object of the preposition: 















29/04/22 

Noun clause as a compliment: 

Compliment: A compliment looks like an object but it is not an object. It mostly comes after a be verb and completes the meaning of the subject. It always follows 
a linking verb. It gives more information about the subject and modifies it. It usually acts as a noun or adjective. It acts as a noun by renaming (Replacing the 
name which is the same person) the subject or acts as an adjective by giving more information about the subject. 


Renaming: Replacing the name which is the same person
Linking verb: it links a subject to a compliment  
Action verb: Action verbs expresses emotions, actions, etc
Both linking and action verb: look, 

Eg.- She is beautiful. 
	(if we write "she is.", the meaning is not clear)

Eg.- 
(i) They look happy.
	Look: linking verb 

(ii) They were looking for a cat. 
	Looking for: to do something (searching) 



Eg,- Sourav is a player. 
		Sourav: noun
		Player: noun 
			(Renaming the subject)
		Therefore, player is a compliment and renaimg the subject. 
	
	Sourav is an amazing player
	Sourav is as amazing player whom we met last week. 
			
			Player: word
			amazing player: phrase
			Whom we met last week: clause (adverbial) 


Types of compliments (5): 

(i) Subject compliment: 

(ii) Object compliment: 

(iii) Adjective compliment: 

(iv) Verb compliment:

(v) Adverbial compliment: 




Object: Object is the result of the action of the verb. 

Compliment: Compliment is a noun, phrase or clause that adds additional information about the subject or object. 

How to identify an object: 
(i) Ask question 'who', 'what'. The answer we get is the object. 

Eg.- She is cooking chicken. 
		Ask: "What is she cooking?" 
			(Ans. chicken)
		
Eg.- I gave her a book 
		Ask: "What did I gave her?"
			Ans: a book 
		

• Object is not possible in a sentence without transitive verb 

Eg.- I kicked the ball
		Kicked: action word
		Ball: result 


Eg.- He seems happy 
		Happy is a compliment because it has no result but gives information about the subject. 
		










24/06/22

Difference between compliment and object: 
 
Compliment:  

Compliment differs from an object it always follows a linking verb (it links a subject to a compliment). If we cannot remove it (compliment) from the sentence, then it 
is compliment. Compliment is a noun, phrase or clause that adds additional information about the subject or object. 



Object: 

Object is the result of the action of the verb. 

How to identify an object: 
We have to ask 'who' or 'what'. The answer we get is the object


Exmaples of Linking verbs: to be, is, am, are, was, were, is being, are being, am being, was being, were being, has been, had been, have been, 

The verbs which act both as linking verbs and action verbs: feel, grow, taste, seem, stay, smell, turn, look, appear, prove. 

How compliment is used as a noun: 
	Balkist is an amazing player who plays in Indian cricket team. 
		is: linking verb; player: compliment; who plays in Indian cricket team: clause; an amazing: phrase
		
		


How a compliment can be used as an adjectice: 
	
	I am thrilled that she is coming to visit us. 

		I: subject; am: linking verb; thrilled: compliment as an adjective; that she is coming to visit us: clause
		
		
		
	We are little surprised why they decided to leave. 
		Surprised: adjective compliment; little surprised: compliment as a phrase. 
	(It's a sentence but the meaning is not clear)

===============================================================================================================================================================================

Adjective clause: 

It is also known as relative clause 

relative pronouns = who, whom, whose, which, whose, that, etc

Adjective clause modifies nouns and pronouns and are placed right after the nouns or pronouns they modify. They usually begin with relative pronouns [modifies: gives more 
information about the noun or pronoun]

ADJECTIVE CLAUSE IS FOLLOWED BY A NOUN OR PRONOUN

Clause: combination of two or more words that make a meaning 

===============================================================================================================================================================================


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Eg.- Have you seen my bag which I kept on the table? 
	Relative pronoun: which 
	adjective clause: "which I kept on the table?"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================================================================================================================

Match 3 things :
(i) Whether the sentece has a noun or pronoun. 
(ii) It is placed just after the noun or pronoun. 
(iii) Whether the clause is giving more information about the noun. 

===============================================================================================================================================================================


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eg.- I have a sister who lives in USA. 
		Relative pronoun: who 
		Noun: sister 
		adjective clause: "who lives in USA." 

Eg.- Mithi who I have invited is coming tomorrow.
		Relative pronoun: who 
		Noun: Mithi 
		Adjective clause: "who i have invited" 
		Main clause: "Mithi is coming tomorrow"

Eg.- My friend whose bicycle has been stolen is going to buy a new one today
		Noun: frined 
		Relative pronoun: whose 
		Adjective clause: whose bicycle has been stolen 
		Main clause: My frined is going to buy a new one today 
   
Eg.- The book which you read yesterday is one of my favourite books. 
		Noun: the book 
		Relative pronoun: which 
		Adjective clause: which you read yesterday

===============================================================================================================================================================================

Adverbial clause: 

An adverb modifies a verb, an adjectice and another adverb 

An adverb clause plays the role of an adverb in a sentence. It begins with a sub-ordinating conjunction. They answer questions like 'why', 'when', 'where', 'how'. 
			They can be placed at the beginning, middle or at the end of a sentence. They can be switched around (we can place it (the clause) anywhere in the sentence). This 
is only possible in adverbial clause. 

!!! If adverbial clause is placed at the beginning of a sentence then we put comma (,) after the clause. If adverbial clause is placed in the middle of a sentence then we put 
two commas (, .... ,), i.e., before the clause and after the clause. If adverbial clause is placed at the end of a sentence then we do not put any comma. 

===============================================================================================================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eg.- I missed the flight because I couldn't get up early.
		I missed the flight: independent clause 
		Because I couldn't get up early: adverbial clause 
		Because: sub-ordinating conjunction. 

Clause at the beginning: 
	Because I couldn't get up early, I missed the flight. 

COMMA IS COMPULSARY

Nelson Mandela states that freedom comes with responsibilities. Discuss how freedom and responsibilities go hand in hand. 

= Freedom is a right to everyone by birth and it is not a privilege for a few selected aristocrats and politicians. Once freedom is obtained, it becomes our responsibility 
to protect it and do not misuse it to suppress other human beings. At that point, freedom becomes an important choice and makes a person more responsible. Nelson Mandela 
said that, "Freedom is indivisible, the chains on anyone of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains on all of my people were the chains on me." Hence freedom 
comes with a huge responsibility to protect it to keep all the people of the nation together.

            															TTRANSFORMATION OF SENTENCES




Subject is important becuase it determines the formation of the sentence 

Sentence: combination of words that make a difinite sense is called a sentence 

Assertive sentences can be negative or positive and ends with full stop 





Sentences can be devided into 4 parts based on the structure 

(i) Simple sentence 
(ii) Compound sentence 
(iii) Complex sentence
(iv) Complex compound sentence 

Simple sentence: 

1 finite verb 

(if we see only 1 finite verb, it is a simple sentence)


To draw paintings is his hobby 



Finite verb: 
The verb which changes its form according to the person, number, tense is called finite verb 

Simple sentence: the sentence that contains one independent clause with one finite verb and a subject is called simple sentence.

Eg: I waited for you 

I: subject
waited: finite verb 
The sentence is independent clause 


Amrita had her dinner late at night. 





Compound sentence: The sentences with two independent clauses joined by coordinating conjuctions are called compound sentence. 



Richa is an excellent student and is also the head girl of our school 


sometimes, the repeatition of words look odd so coordinating conjunction help in replacing the word 




07/10/22

Eg: I have to do it. 

Person: He has to do it. 

Number: They have to do it. 

Tense: You had to do it 




I have been doing it.

He has been doing it.

She had been doing it. 

We have been doing it. 



Non-finite verb: A verb form which is not changed with the change of tense, person or number is called non-finite verb.

• In a simple sentence, there may be more than one non-finite verb but only one finite verb will be there in simple sentence 

• In a simple sentece, there may be up to 4 non-finite verbs. Non-finite verb - to + V1 / V3  / V1 + ing 

	Eg: They may have been being harassed 

		Finite: may 
		Non-finite: have, been, being, harassed




to + V1 - to eat 

V3 - been 

V1 + ing - being



Whenever we see modals in any sentence, only the modal will be changed. (meaning: the modal is the finite verb)



In a sentence, the first verb is always finite verb and others are non-finite. 

• Compound sentences have another name i.e., Coordinator 

Sita is my sister and Rita is my cousin 

And Rita is my cousin, Sita is my sister. 


• In compound sentences, inversion of sentences or clauses is not possible. 

Eg: I went to see her but I could not speak to her. 


• If the subjects of both clauses are co-referrential, we can leave out (skip) the subject of the second clause from a compound sentence.







8/10/22

She was alone but Mina stayed there the whole night. 


In a compound sentense, if the sentece starts with pronoun and then noun then it is not essential that both the subjects are the same person.

The pronoun of the first clause and the noun of the second clause may not be co-referrential in a compound sentence 



Complex sentence: sentences with one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses are called complex sentences. The clauses are joined by subordinating 
conjunctions (when, before, though, although, because, etc) or relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that, etc)


• Complex sentences have another name, i.e., subordinator


Eg: If you study hard, you will pass. 

You will pass if you study hard 

Both the sentences are correct


In complex sentences, inversion of clauses is possible 

Eg: As I am going out, I can't meet you today. 

    As I am going out, can't meet you today. 

• In complex sentences, we cannot skip the subject of the second clause 

If the subjects of both clauses are co-referrential, we cannot leave out the subject from the second clause in complex sentense 




She was alone but Mina stayed there the whole night. 

Though she was alone, Mina stayed there the whole night. 


The pronoun of the first clause and the noun of the second clause are co-referrential in a complex sentence 








Complex compound sentence 

• A sentence that contains both two main clauses (independent clauses) and one or more subordinate clauses is called a complex compound sentence. Both coordinating and 
subordinating conjunctions are used to join the clauses. 


Eg:  Kalyani forgot Diya's birthday, so she sent her a gift card as soon as she realised it. 




Eg: He was not at his home but I went there 





11/11/22

Assertive: declaration or statement and it ends with full stop. 

Exclamatory sentence: expression of strong feeling. They end with an exclamation mark. Some words are especially used in the start, eg.- alas, oh, wow, hurrah. Expression 
of our triumph feelings. Formation eg: What + a/an + adjectice + noun + subject + verb 

How + adjectice + subject + verb 


Eg: What a beautiful picture it is. 

Imperative sentences: they are used to give command, advice, order, request, etc. These type of sentences start with verb (you is hidden). Ends with full stop.

Eg: Please open the door.
[This is not an actual sentence]

Open the door please.

Interrogative sentence: sentences that are used to ask questions 

Formation: 'wh' word + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb + ... + ? 

sometimes, it starts as- auxiliary verb + subject + main verb + ... + ? 


Eg: how is your health now? 

How are you? 



• sometimes the main verb is not after the subject. so the auxiliary becomes the main verb 


|||||| THE MEANING MUST NOT BE CHANGED |||||| 


Interchange of affirmative and negative sentences: 

3 rules for changing: 

(i) Using antonyms of some words (adjectice, verb, noun, adverb) in the sentence. 


Eg: I always remember to wish her on her birthday
= I never forget to wish her on her birthday. 


(ii) Converting an affirmative sentence into a negative interrogative sentence

Eg: He wants to buy a car.
= Doesn't he want to buy a car? 
[this sentence is used to confirm a sentence]

• these sentences are also knwon as question tag. 

(iii) Replacing the word with another 
Choose a word and replace it with another which completes the meaning 
[no fixed rule]


Eg: only the participants will get a certificate. 
=> None but the participants will get a certificate.



Interchange of Assertive to interrogative sentences 


If an assertive sentence is positive, it will be negative in the interrogative form and vice versa 

Eg: She is an intelligent girl. 
=> Isn't she an intelligent girl? 

Eg: Mr. Sharma doesn't want to go to another city 
= Does Mr. Sharma want to go to another city. 

If positive sentence is there, we have to make it negative interrogative. 
If the sentece is negative, we have to make it positive interrogative.



Interchange of interrogative to assertive sentence 

(i) While changing from interrogative to assertive, we have to change the sentences from affirmative to negative.

Eg: is this the right way to behave? 
This is not the right way to behave. 


Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
=> No one knows what will happen tomorrow. 


Interchange of exclamatory sentences to assertive sentences 

An exclamatory sentence can be changed to assertive sentence by expressing the feelings as a statement. We have to remove the words like 'what', how', 'oh', 'wow', 
'hurrah', 'how', 'what', 'alas', etc. and add words like 'very', 'certainly', 'extremely' etc. 


Eg: How fool is the man! 
=> The man is very fool. 


Eg: If only I had studied. 





12/10/22

Assertive to exclamatory sentenses 


Some words must be used which are in the middle of the sentence: 


It is a wonderful piece of art 

= What a wonderful piece of art it is! 



Imperative to assertive 


Modal auxiliaries are used according to the context of the sentence while changing from imperative to assertive sentences 

Stop the car.

S + v + o 

You should stop the car. 

Sit down

You can sit down   




Interchange of simple to compound sentences 

Simple sentences can be changed into compound sentences by adding a coordinating conjunction

• He use "having + past participle" to convert a sentence from compound to simple

Eg: The workers finished their work and went home. 

= Having finished their work, the workers went home.
                                                                         
Having finished = non finite 



13/10/22

present participle is also an infinitive 

He was down with flu, so could not go for the match.

Being considerate, she has helped him. 

She has helped him out of / on account of consideration 



Interchange of simple and complex sentences
