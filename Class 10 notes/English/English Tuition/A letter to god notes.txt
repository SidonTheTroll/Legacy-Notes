In the entire valley, there was only one house at the top of a low hill and Lencho and his family lived there. From that height, the river and the field of ripe corns can be seen properly 

The only thing Lencho and his crop wanted was a downpour (rain) or at least a shower 

Lencho had hoped for rain by seeing the sky towarda the north-east 

Lencho's older boyes were working in the field and the younger ones were playing near the house 

When Lencho and his family was having dinner, drops of rain began to fall 

The raindrops were represented as coins because all his crops wanted was rain and when it poured, his crops can ripe 

With the rain, heavy winds began to and large hailstones began to fall destroying Lencho's house 

After the hailstorm, Lencho's field was destroyed and the surrounding looking whilt like it was covered with salt 

Lencho's family members only hoped for god to help them 

Lencho said that it seemed like a total loss but nobody dies of hunger 

In the following sunday morning, Lencho strted to write a letter to god 

Lencho wanted 100 pesos to sow his field again and live until the crop ripes

At first, the postmaster started laughing at Lencho's letter but soon became serious and tried to help Lencho 

In order not to shake Lencho's fait in god, th postmaster gathered money from his salary, his employees and from friends and managed to gather 70 pesos 

The postmaster sent the money to Lencho in a letter with one word as a signature: "God"

Lencho was upset at god because he didn't got the full money from god and thought that the post office employees and the postmaster took it 

Lencho wrote a letter to god again where he asked to get the rest of the money and not to send him through the mail because the post office employees are a bunch of crooks
