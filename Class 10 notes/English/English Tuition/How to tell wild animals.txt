This poem is about large dangerous animals 

If you ever get a chance to visit the jungles of the east, and you come across a large beast of if the color of the beast is brown and if it roars at you and you feel that you are going to die, 
you will recognise its an asian lion 

When we are roaming and a noble wild beast greets us, and if the color is yellow-ground and with black stripes and follow whether it is going to eat you, you will recognis that the bengal tiger

If walking slowly, if we see a beast whose skin is covered with spots all over the body, you will know that it is a leopard. It will do no good to roar in pain because it will leap on us and eat us 

if we see a creature in the backyard and it holds us very tightly, we will be sure that it is a bear. If wethe bear have any doubt if we are alive, it will crush its prey again 

A non-experienced person will get confused are asked to distinguish the beasts. The hyenas will come with wide smiles. if the animal is crying and the other animal is crying, we have to know that it is a crocodile 

If a tree doesnt has any type of animal and insect we have to know that there is a chameleon. we cant find it because it changes his color
