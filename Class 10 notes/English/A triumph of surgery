Tricki was a pet dog of a rich owner 

Due to Tricki's feeding habits, he became fat like a bloated sausage with bloodshot and watery eyes 

Mrs. Pumphrey thought that Tricki was suffering from malnutrition and started giving him a lot of food and made him do no exercise at all which made him fat 

The only fault of Tricki was greed because he never refused food and will consume any meal at any hour of the day 

Mr. Herriot adviced Mrs. Pumphrey to give Tricki less food and make him do a lot of exercise or else he is going to be severely ill 

Tricki had a whole wardrobe of coats 

Tricki was hospitalised for a fortnight because he would eat nothing (refused his favoirite food), vomited, didn't went out for walks and lied on the rug all day panting 

Mr. Herriot wrapped Tricki in a blanket and maids rushed to bring day bed, night bed, favourite cushions, toys, rubber rings, breakfast bowl, lunch bowl and dinner bowl for Tricki. 

When Tricki entered the hospital, other dogs surrounded him and Tricki looked down with dull eyes 
    Other dogs sniffed him and later decided that he was an uninteresting object and ignored him 

Herriot made a bed out of loose box for Tricki next to where the other dogs slept 

Herriot didn't gave Tricki any food but plenty of water 

Joe was a greyhound who was Tricki's friend 

After 2 days, Tricki too, started rushing for the food bowl and killed the rats in the old hen house
