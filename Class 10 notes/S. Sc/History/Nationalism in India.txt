3 mass movements by Gandhi: 
    Non-cooperation movement: 1920 
    Civil Disobedience: 1930
    Quit India movement: 1942
 

Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919) and Rowlatt act (repressive act to dominate Indians) marked the start of non-cooperation
movement 

Early phase of non-cooperation movement: Khilafat movement 

Ali Brothers: Muhammad Ali and Saukat Ali 

Swadeshi & boycott movement started after the partition of Bengal  

Under the leadership of General Dyer, the British soldiers open fired in Jallianwala Bagh which was the reason of Satyagrah movement 

The tribals and grass-root people also helped Mahatma Gandhi in the movement 

Gandhiji came back to India from South Africa in 1915 

After a year, he supported the Champaran peasants which led to the Champaran revolution 

Satyagrah according to Gandhiji: Noble truth, ahinsa/non-violence 

Gandhiji suspended the Non-cooperation movement in 1922 because the Satyagrahis killed some policemen in Gorakhpur 

Starting of Khilafat movement against the British because the British government disregarded the Khalifats
    They protested against the East India Company 

Decisions/aims of non-cooperation movement by Gandhiji: 
    (i) Boycott British goods and services 
    (ii) Surrender the honorary titles by the British 
    (iii) The government workers must resign 

Mahatma Gandhi became popular because of non-violence and simplicity. 

Repressive acts by British: 
    (i) Rowlatt act of 1919 
    (ii) Indian Council act of 1909 
            According to Indian Council act, only the people selected by the British government can work in the administration (they were all British
            supporters)

The Indian revolutionaries wanted to cripple the British economy 




Civil Disobedience of 1930 

Reasons: 
    (i) No salt (salt march)

The salt march was also known as Salt Satyagraha movement 

240 miles were marched by Gandhi to protest against the British government 
    Because of this, the British government took action against the satyagrahis which was the reason for the rise of feelings of nationalism in India 

Mahatma Gandhi was invited to the Round table conference in London. 
    Gandhi demanded the Brits to release all the political prisoners without any trial. But the Brits didn't did so and thus Gandhi didn't 
went to London to attend the meeting. 

British aim: divide the Indians and disunite them. 


First mass struggle: 1919-1920 non-cooperation movement

Major reasons why Rowlatt act was hugely opposed: 
    It gave the government power to supperss political activities and imprision anyone without any trial 

Actions by Indians: strikes, road blocks and shops were closed 

After Rowlatt act, nationwide satyagrahi movements were started 
        Rallies were organised against the British government 

Dandi march: Started by Gandhi 
             78 diligates joined him 
             240 miles was travelled by them from Sabarmati to Dandi 

11 demands by Indian nationalist leaders for the participation of Round-table conference

Gandhi went to London because he was invited by Lord Irwin for the Round-table conference and Gandhi wanted 11 demands to be accepted but since he was 
not paid any attention and didn't did as he demanded, Gandhi came back to India and started the Civil Disobedience once again.

    Foreign clothes were burned and not worn 
    Merchants and traders disagreed to buy foreign goods and clothes 
    Foreign inventors didn't invested money in the Brithsh Indian stocks

The Boycott movement slowed down in the cities because the British clothes were cheaper and smoother.

    Leaders:
        Baba Ramchandra 
        Alluri Sitaram Raju 
    
Civil restrictions: 
    Banned shifting cultivation and collecting fuelwood from forests 
    Banned the grazing of animals in the British claimed forest 

Baba Ramchandra was a bounded labourer in Fiji 

Peasants were working as slaves for the British in return for nothing which severely affected them and their life 

Tribals were forced to resettle after British took their land where they used get gather materials to run their families 

Classes of forests: 
    Reserved 
    Protected 
    Unreserved 
    


Lord Curzon partitioned Bengal to create disunity among hindus and muslims 





Boycott foreign goods (including goods, services, schools, jobs, colleges, etc) 

Alluri Sitaram Raju claimed to have miraclous powers by which he can't be shot dead and can tell other's futures by astrology, etc. 

Slogans by satyagrahis: Swatantra Bharat 

For the majority position, politicians convince the grass-root people for votes and rich people for financial help





Personification of India By Abanindranath Tagore called "Bharat Mata" to fight the British with their sentiment. 

Vernacular (regional) languages were used in pamphlets and books to grow the sentiment and enlighten the Indians about their oppression by the British 

Lower caste people supported Gandhiji in the mass struggle 

Bhim Rao Ambedkar was the Dalit leader during the struggle 

The Dalit communities played a major role in the independence 

The brahmins were in the top-most position in the caste system because they perform all the religious ceremonies. 

On 6 April, Dandi march started
