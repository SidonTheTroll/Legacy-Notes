Globalisation: The method of communicating with the world by trade is called Globalisation

Types of globalisation: 
    Trade: Trade of goods 
    Capital: Trade of money
    Labour: migration of labour to work 

Through trade, it helps to increase the national income

With globalisation, a country or region gets ideas to develop their existing technology 

By bi-latreal discussions and aggrements, every country exports and imports goods 

In 1498, Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India by Cape of Good Hope

Globalisation helps to develop socia-cultural and economic relations with other counties 

Spaghetti, noodles and pasta were bought to India by trade 

Globalisation has a risk of spreading diseases like smallpox, renderpest and cowpox

Renderpest caused faine in Africa by killing the cattle 

Silk road connects China to Europe 

Sweet potatoes, potatoes, chinese mustard leaves, etc were imported to India from other countries 

Sometimes, global nations try to dominate weaker nations 

Diseases were also spread by frozon meat brought in the ships 

In globalisation, all trade barriers were lifted so that every country can freely trade with others 

The wars created economic depression in the regions affected 

Economic branches were formed to established global economic system 

Reasons for World War 1: 
(i) Alsaes and Lorraine was the reason of France joining Triple Entente (to take revenge on Germany)
(ii) Imperialist rivalaries 
(iii) Formation of two hostile camps, i.e., Triple Entente and Triple Alliance 

Reasons for World War 2: 
(i) Treaty of Versailles, 28 June 1919 
(ii) Economic depression all over the world  
(ii) Rise of Nazism in Germany 

International Monetary fund and World Bank were formed to restructure the global economy 

The food crops were so much traded that nobody knows where they originally belong to 

More territory = more power = more prestige 

Trade => national income => more per capita income => people will live better life => better technology

â€¢ Labour and capital are mobile but labour doesn't has bargainig power and they are mostly busy in hazardous jobs 

Industrialisation: county shifts from primary sector to socondary sector with dramatic changes 

Tripartite pact: signed between Germany, Italy and Japan to protect each other 

1917: USA joined Triple Entente and made the Allied power 

Corn law: a law introduced in England which restricts the import of corn from other counties

Emigration:

50 million people left Europe and resettled to America for better job opportunuties which mainly consisted of lower class people 

All over the world, 150 million people left their home because of economic crisis 

workers left because of excess work and machines took over their work 

During 1890, global agriculture economy took shape which led to complex changes in the labour movement pattern 

Types of migration: 
    Internal 
    External 

Import of goods resulted in the poor peasants losing their job 

MNC: Multi National Companies 


Only due to technology, the food that we didn't had earlier, is now available at cheapest price. 

Processed canned meat decreases transport charge and maintainance.
    These all are facilitated by steam engine and boat. 

The frozen meat brought to Europe helped the people to have a varied diet. 

Technology -> Industrialisation -> higher income 

Animals used to become unfit to eat after they are imported living in the ships 
    Reason why meat was a luxary 


Colonial period: A time period under which a country or region is regined by any other imperialist country. 
    All this shit was done for raw materials 

Colonial period was also a time when the natives were exploited 


The Africans were forced to work in the plantations as bounded labours 

Animal rearing was the main occupation of the Africans and were self sufficient so they didn't saw the need to work elsewhere 

Europians were attracted by the vast land and recources of South Africa 

According to British policy, only one member of the family was allowed to inherit the property 

The miners were forced to only live in the mines 

Only the people who worked for the Bitish could pay the taxes 
    These all gave rise to bounded labours
