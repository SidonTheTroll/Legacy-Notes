For development, people see what is the most important for them 

Two people have different goals of development. 

What may be development for one may not be the development for the other. It may also be destructive 

Farmers want regular work, better wages and decent price for their products (grains and crops)

Except money, people also want equal treatment, freedom, security and respect of others 

Different persons have different notions as well as conflicting notions of the country's development
