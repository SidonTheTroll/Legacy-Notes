1. Define GDP. How do we define GDP? 
= GDP or Gross Domestic Produce is the quantitative produce of a nation's total economic activity. It represents the monetary value of all goods and 
services produced within a nation's geographic borders over a specific period of time. 
            We calculate GDP in the following way: 
(i) The value of goods and services in the three sectors and calculated and then added up. 
(ii) The value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year promotes the total production of the sector. 
(iii) The sum of three sectors of production in three sectors gives the GDP of a country. 
(iv) Not every goods and services provided and sold required to be calculated. It makes sense only to include final goods and services. 

2. Describe the role played by MGNREGA in improving the employment situation in India. 
= Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was passed by the Central Government in 2005 to implement the 'Right to Work' in 200 districts 
and now implemended in 625 districts in India. MGNREGA is to be implemended mainly by the Gram Panchayats and the Involvement of contracters is banned. 
Apart from providing economic security and creating rural assets, MGNREGA also helps in protecting the environment, empowering women, reducing 
rural-urban migration and fostering social equity among others. 
            Following are the measures taken under MGNREGA to help the rural poor: 
(i) This act provides hundred days assured employment every year to every households 
(ii) One third of the proposed jobs would be reserved for women. 
(iii) If an applicant is not provided employment withing 15 days, he/she will be entitled to a daily emplyment allowance.
