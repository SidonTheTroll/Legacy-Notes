Explain the sharing of power among different social groups.
= Power is shared among different social groups such as religious and linguistic groups. The community government in Belgium is an good example of a local form 
of government which deals with the cultural, educational and language related issues in a certain area. In some countries, there are arrangements for the 
minorities, weaker section of the society and woment to take part in the legislature and administration. In our country, it is called Reserved Constituenties 
which is meant to give space in the government and administration to diverse social groups so that they can get the fair share of power. 

Explain the sharing of power among political parties, pressure groups and movement groups. 
= In India, we have multi-party system, i.e., we have multiple political parties which take part in the elections in the national level and the state level. 
This results in tense competition and points our the faults and defects in one party which the other party can solve. As a result, parties learn from their
mistakes and the next party which won the election will be better that the earlier one. 
                Â­In a democratic form of government, pressure groups and movement groups are given certain rights to point out mistakes and and also pressureize  
for their rights and certain changes in the society. Although the government monitors and makes changes in the county, a few peoblems are not taken seriously or 
they don't know that it exists. In those conditions, the movement and pressure groups take the initiative and protest for their demands, if when succeeded, the 
government is bound to introduce the bill and make changes in the laws for the improvment for the society.
