# Clauses 
- 1 verb = simple sentence 
    - More than 1 verb = complex sentence 

- Clause is a group of words containing a verb and a subject. It is a part of a sentence or a sentence by itself. 

- **How to find a clause**: 
    - At least two parts (a subject and a verb) must be there in a clause. 
    - Sometimes the second subject is omitted, it is also a clause  
    - When the sentence has two subjects and verbs, it is a clause 100%

- Types of clauses 
    1. **Independent clause**: main clause 
        - These are clauses that make complete sence on their own. 
    2. **Dependent clause**: subordinate clause
        - These are the clauses that cannot make complete sense on their own and depend on the main clause to make their maening complete. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Conjunctions** are required to **join clauses**. 
> Eg: **coordinating conjunctions** (eg. and, for, or, yet, but, not, so, nor, etc.) and **corelative conjunction** (either, or, neither, nor, etc.)

- In a clause the minimum criteria is there should be one main clause and one subordinate clause but there can be more than one main clause and more than one subordinate clause in a clause

- **Connnecting two main clauses**
    > Eg. Ram is studing and/but Hari is playing. 
    - For connecting main clauses we use 'and' and 'but'.
- **Connecting main clause and a subordinate clause** 
    - For this, we use **subordinating conjunction**, i.e., when, before, though, although, because, etc.
    - We can also use **relative pronouns**, i.e., who, whom, whose, which, whos, that, etc.

# Coordinating Conjunctions 
Coordinating conjunctio is a word that joins two elements of equal grammatical rand or importance. They can join two verbs, adjectives, phrases, nouns and independent clauses. 

> Seeema is cooking and Ravi is serving. 
> > Here, **and** is the **coordinating conjunction**. 

# Correlative Conjunction
Corelative conjunctions work in pairs to join words, phrases, clauses. Its examples are either, or; neither, nor; not only, but also; whether, or; both, and; etc. 

# Subordinating Conjunction 
A subordinating conjunction is a **word or phrase that joins a dependent clause to an Independent clause**. 

> The girl who called me yesterday is my sister 
>> who = relative pronoun

## Types and uses of Subordinating Conjunctions 
1. **To indicate time**: till, until, once, before, after, since, when, while, as long as, as soon as, whenever 
2. **To indicate condition**: if, unless, had, whether or not, provided, when, since, while, 
3. **To indicate position**: where, whererver, everywhere, anywhere
4. **To indicate reason**: because, in case, as much as, since, in so far as, as in case, just, as 
5. **To indicate purpose**: so, that, so that, in order, so as to, in case
6. **To indicate consequence**: since, as, therefore, as a result, so that, 
7. **To indicate contrast**: even, though, although, even if, whereas, despite, even though
8. **To indicate comparision**: however, that, yet, still, but, nevertheless, on the other hand. 
9. **To indicate comparision or manner**: like, as , as... as, if, the way, then

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Coordinating conjunction** are used to **connect main clauses**
> - **Corelative conjunction** are used to **join main clauses** or to **form compound sentences**
> - Conjunctions are used to **join subordinating dependent clause to independent clause** 

# Types of Dependent Clauses 
## Noun Clause
A noun clause is used as a noun in a sentence. They act as a subject of a sentence, as an object of the verb, as an object of the preposition, as a compliment. 

- **Subject of a sentence**: 
    - What he said was interesting. 
        - was interesting = main clause 
        - was = main verb 
        - what he said = noun 
- **Object of the verb** 
    - He asked why I was late. 
        - he asked = main clause 
        - asked = main verb 
        - why I was late = subordinate clause 
- **Object of the preposition** 
    - I loved at what she had done. 
        - at = preposition 
        - what she had done = object 

### Why do we use noun clause? 
We use noun clause when a single noun is not enough to complete the meaning of a sentence. 

- **To identify a noun clause:**
    - Conjunctions: who, whoever, whom, what, whatever, whomever, where, whererver, which, whichever, why, whether, how, that, if. 
    - To identify a noun clause just ask 'what'. The answer we get on that question is the noun clause.
    - To confirm if it is a noun clause, we have to replace it with a pronoun. (he, she, that, this, it, you, their, etc)

Noun clauses are placed in a sentence as a subject of a sentence, object of the verb, object of the preposition and as a compliment. 

- **Subject of a sentence:**
    - How she behaved was very rude. 
        - Starts with "how". 
        - What behaved very rude? = "She behaved very rude." This is the noun clause.
        - 'How she behaved?' She/ It/ That behaved very rude. 

- At least a subject and a verb are required to complete a sentence.
- We consider the verb in the main clause as the main verb. 

- Dependent clause starts with a conjunction. 

- **Noun clause as a subject in the sentence:**
    - Eg: What you do in your free time is your hobby. 
        - "What you do in your free time" = subject 
        - "is" = main verb 
        - "your hobby" = object 
        - "What" = preposition 
- **Noun clause as an object of the verb:**
    - Eg: He did not realise that he had done a mistake. 
        - "That" = conjunction 
        - "That he had done is a mistake" = dependent clause 
        - "HE did not realised" = main clause 
        - What didn't he realise?: "He did not realised his mistake."
    - Eg: I didn't know why I was going to meet her. 
        - "Why": conjunction 
        - "I didn't know": independent clause 
        - "Why I was going to meet her." = dependent clause 

### Noun clause as an object of the preposition
- **Compliment:** A compliment looks like an object but it is not an object. It mostly comes after a 'be verb' and completes the meaning of the subject. It always follows a linking verb. It gives more information about the subject and modifies it. It usually acts as a noun or adjective. It ats as a noun by renaming (replacing the name which is the same person) the subject or acts as an adjective by giving more information about the subject. 

- Renaming: Replacing the name which is the same person. 
- Linking verb: it links a subject to a compliment. 
- Action verb: action verbs expresses emotions, actions, etc. 
    - **Example of both linking and action verb**: look, grow, feel, smell, taste, sound, remain, stay, turn, appear, prove.

- Types of compliments: 
    1. Subject compiment 
    2. Object compliment 
    3. Adjective compliment 
    4. Verb compliment 
    5. Adverbial compliment

### Difference between Compliment and Object 
- **Compliment:** compliment differs from an object. It always follows a linking verb (it links a subject to a compliment). If we cannot remove it (compliment) from the sentence, then it is a compliment. Compliment is a noun, phrase or clause that adds additional information about the subject or object. 
- **Object**: Object is the result of the action of the verb. 

> How to identify an Object? 

We have to ask 'who' or 'what'. The answer we get is the object.

- Exmaples of Linking verbs: to be, is, am, are, was, were, is being, are being, am being, was being, were being, has been, had been, have been, etc.

- How compliment is used as a noun: 
    - Balkist is an amazing player who plays in Indian Cricket team. 
        - "is" = linking verb
        - "player" = compliment
        - "who plays in Indian cricket team" = clause
        - "an amazing" = phrase 

### How a Compliment can be used as an adjective 
- I am thrilled that she is coming to visit us. 
    - I = subject 
    - am = linking verb 
    - thrilled = compliment as an adjective 
    - that she is coming to visit us = clause 
- We are little surprised why they decided to leave. 
    - surprised = adjective compliment 
    - little surprised = compliment as a phrase 

## Adjective Clause 
This is also known as relative clause. 

- Relative pronouns: who, whom whose, which, whose, that, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Adjective clause modifies nouns and pronouns and are placed right after the nouns or pronouns they modify. They usually begin with relative pronouns [modifies: gives more information about the noun or pronoun]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ADJECTIVE CLAUSE IS FOLLOWED BY A NOUN OR PRONOUN
> - Clause: combination of two or more words that make a meaning.

## Adverbial Clause 
- An adverb modifies a verb, an adjectice and another adverb 

An adverb clause plays the role of an adverb in a sentence. It begins with a sub-ordinating conjunction. They answer questions like 'why', 'when', 'where', 'how'.  
They can be placed at the beginning, middle or at the end of a sentence. They can be switched around (we can place it (the clause) anywhere in the sentence). This 
is only possible in adverbial clause. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If adverbial clause is placed at the beginning of a sentence then we put comma (,) after the clause. If adverbial clause is placed in the middle of a sentence then we put two commas (, .... ,), i.e., before the clause and after the clause. If adverbial clause is placed at the end of a sentence then we do not put any comma. 

- I missed the flight because I couldn't get up early.
	- I missed the flight = independent clause 
	- Because I couldn't get up early = adverbial clause 
	- Because = sub-ordinating conjunction. 
    - Clause at the beginning: Because I couldn't get up early, I missed the flight. 
    - **COMMA IS COMPULSARY**
- My neighbour, when he is angry, starts shouting. 
    - Main clause: My neighbour starts shouting. 
	- Clause: When he is angry. 
- After the home assignment is done, I will sleep for some time.
	- Conjunction: after 
	- Adverbial clause: After the home assignment is done, 
	- Main clause: I will sleep for some time. 
    - Switch around: I will sleep for some time after the home assignment is done. 
- **Dependent clause at the end**: My neighbour starts shouting when he is angry. 
- After the home assignment, I will sleep for some time. 
    - Conjunction: after 
    - Adevrbial clause: After the home assignment is done, 
    - Main clause: I will sleep for some time. 
    - Switch around: I will sleep for some time after the home assignment is done.
