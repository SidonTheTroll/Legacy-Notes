# Types of Sentences 
- **Assertive sentence:** declaration or statement and it ends with full stop.
- **Exclamatory sentence:** expression of strong feeling. They end with an exclamation mark. Some words are especially used in the start, eg., alas, oh, wow, hurrah. Expression of our triumph feelings. 
    - Formation: **What + a/an + adjective + noun + subject + verb**. Or, **How + adjective + subject + verb**. 
        - Eg.: What a beautiful picture it is. 
- **Imperative Sentences:** they are used to give command, advice, order, request, etc. These types of sentences start with verb ('you' is hidden). Ends with a full stop.
    - Eg.: Please open the door.
        - Open the door please. 
- **Interrogative sentence:** sentences that are used to ask questions. 
    - Formation: 'wh' word + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb + ...+ ?
    - Sometimes, it start as: **auxiliary verb + subject + main verb + ... +? **
        - Eg: How is your health now? 
        - Eg: How are you? 
            - Sometimes, the main verb is not after the subject. So, the auxiliary verb becomes the main verb. 
                - BUT THE MEANING SHOULD NOT CHANGE.

# Interchange of Sentences 
## Interrogative to Assertive Sentence 
While changing from interrogative to assertive sentence, we have to change the sentences from affirmative to negative. 

- Eg: Is this the right way to behave? 
    - This is not the right way to behave. 
- Eg: Who knows what will happen tomorrow? 
    - No one knows what will happen tomorrow. 

## Exclamatory to Assertive Sentence 
While changing from interrogative to assertive sentence by **expressing the feeling as a statement**. We have to remove the words like 'what', 'how', 'oh', 'wow', 'hurrah', 'alas', etc. and add words like 'very', 'certainly', 'extremely', etc. 

- Eg: How fool is the main! 

## Assertive to Exclamatory Sentence 
Some words must be used which are in the middle of the sentence. 

- Eg: It is a wonderful piece of art. 
    - What a wonderful piece of art it is!

## Simple to Compound Sentences 
Simple sentences can be changed into compound sentences by adding a coordinating conjunction.

    - He returned home and took his bag. 

## Compound to Simple Sentences 
- Use "having + past participle" to convert a sentence from compound to simple. 

- Eg: The workers finished their work and went home. 
    - Having finished their work, the workers went home. 
        - having finished = non-finite 

We can convert compound sentences to simple sentences by using infinitives (non-finite verb)

> Present participle is also an infinitive.

- Eg: he was down with flu, so could not go for the match. 
    - Being down with flu, he could not go for the match. 
        - 'could' is the finite verb. 

We can also convert compound sentences to sipmle sentences by changing one of the clauses into a word or phrase. 

- Eg: She is considerate, so she has helped him. 
    - Being considerate, she has helped him.
        - She has helped him [out of]/[on account of] consideration. 
        
## Interchange of Simple and Complex Sentences 
A simple sentence can be changed into a complex sentence by expanding it into any one of the three types of clauses.  
We can change an adjective or an adjective phrase into an adjective clause. 
- Eg: I saw a fantistic film yesterday. 
    - I saw a film yesterday which was fantastic.
