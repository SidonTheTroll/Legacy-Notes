# Transformation of Sentences 
- Simple sentence: 1 verb 
- Compound sentence: 2 or more independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions (and, for, or, yet, but, not, so, etc.). They may have a comma or two. 
- Complex sentence: 1 independent clause and 1 or more subordinating clauses joined by subordinating conjunctions (when, whenever, that, before, through , although, because, etc.)

After the phrase "one of the", we have to use a plural nooun in the sentence.

---------- 

> [!NOTE]
> - Subject is important because it determines the formation of the sentence. 
> - **Sentence:** combination of words that make a definite sense is called a sentence. 
> - Assertive sentences can be negative or positive and ends with full stop. 

- Sentences can be divided into 4 parts based on the structure. 
    1. Simple sentence 
    2. Compound sentence 
    3. Complex sentence 
    4. Complex compound sentence 

## Simple Sentence 
These are the sentence that contains one independent clause with one finite verb and a subject is called simple sentence. 

- Has one finite verb. 
    - **Finite verb:** The verb which changes its form according to the person, number, tense is called finite verb. 

> If we see only one finite verb, it is a simple sentence. 

- Eg.: To draw paintings is his hobby. 
- Eg.: I waited for you. 
    - Waited: finite verb 
    - The sentence is an independent clause. 
- Eg.: Amrita had her dinner late at night. 

## Compound Sentence 
The sentences with two independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions are called compound sentences. 

- Eg.: Richa is an excellent student and is also the head girl of our school.

> Sometimes, the repeatition of words look odd so coordinating comjunction help in replacing the word. 

- Eg: I have to do it 
    - **Person:** he has to do it. 
    - **Number:** They have to do it. 
    - **Tense:** You had to do it. 

I have been doing it.  
He has been doing it.  
She had been doing it.  
We have been doing it.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Non-finite verb:** a verb which doesn't change its form with the change of tense, person or number is called non-finite verb.
>   - In a simple sentence, there may be more than one non-finite verb but only one finite verb will be there in simple sentence. 
>   - In a simple sentence, there may be up to 4 non-finite verbs. Non-finite verb: to + V1/V3/V1 + ing 

- Eg: They may have been being harassed.
    - **Finite:** may 
    - **Non-finite:** have, been, being, harassed. 

> [!NOTE]
> - to + V1 = to eat  
> - V3 = been  
> - V1 + ing = being 

Whenever we see modals in any sentence, only the modal will be changed (meaning: the modal is the finite verb).

In a sentence, the first verb is always finite verb and others are non-finite. 

> [!TIP]
> Compound sentences have another name, i.e., **Coordinator**. 
> 
> - Sita is my sister and Rita is my cousin. 
> And Rita is my cousin, Sita is my sister. 

In compound sentences, inversion of sentences or clauses is not possible. 

- Eg: I went to see her but I could not speak to her. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In a compound sentence, if a sentence starts with pronoun and then noun then it is not essential that both the subjects are the same person. 
> - If the subjects of both clauses are co-referrential, we can leave out (skip) the subject of the sencond clause from a compound sentence. 

## Complex Sentence
Sentences with one independent clause and one or more subordinate clause are called complex sentences. The clauses are joined by subordinating conjunctions (when, before, though, although, because, etc.) or relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that, etc.)

- Complex sentences have another name, i.e., **Subordinator**

- Eg: If you study hard, you will pass. 
    - You will pass if you study hard. 
        - Both sentences are correct. 

> [!NOTE]
> In complex sentences, inversion of clauses is possible. 

- Eg.: As I am going out, I can't meet you today. 
    - I can't meet you today as I am going out. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- In complex sentences, we cannot skip the subject of the second clause. 

If the subjects of both clauses are co-referrential, we cannot leave out the subject from the second clause in complex sentences. 

- Eg.: She was alone but Mina stayed there the whole night. 
    - Though she was alone, Mina stayed there the whole night. 

The pronound of the first clause and the noun of the second clause are co-referrential in a comple sentence. 

## Complex Compound Sentence 
A sentence that contains both two main clauses (independent clauses) and one or more subordinate clause is called complex compound sentence.  
Both coordinating and subordinating conjunctions are used to join the clauses. 

- Eg.: Kalyani forgot Diya's birthday, so she sent her a gist card as soon as she realised it. 
- Eg.: He was not at his home but I went there.
