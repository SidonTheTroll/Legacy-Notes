## Simple Sentence 
These are the sentence that contains one independent clause with one finite verb and a subject is called simple sentence. 

- Has one finite verb. 
    - **Finite verb:** The verb which changes its form according to the person, number, tense is called finite verb. 

> If we see only one finite verb, it is a simple sentence. 

- Eg.: To draw paintings is his hobby. 
- Eg.: I waited for you. 
    - Waited: finite verb 
    - The sentence is an independent clause. 
- Eg.: Amrita had her dinner late at night. 

## Compound Sentence 
The sentences with two independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions are called compound sentences. 

- Eg.: Richa is an excellent student and is also the head girl of our school.

> Sometimes, the repeatition of words look odd so coordinating comjunction help in replacing the word. 

- Eg: I have to do it 
    - **Person:** he has to do it. 
    - **Number:** They have to do it. 
    - **Tense:** You had to do it. 

I have been doing it.
He has been doing it.
She had been doing it. 
We have been doing it.
