# Clauses 
- 1 verb = simple sentence 
    - More than 1 verb = complex sentence 

- Clause is a group of words containing a verb and a subject. It is a part of a sentence or a sentence by itself. 

- **How to find a clause**: 
    - At least two parts (a subject and a verb) must be there in a clause. 
    - Sometimes the second subject is omitted, it is also a clause  
    - When the sentence has two subjects and verbs, it is a clause 100%

- Types of clauses 
    1. **Independent clause**: main clause 
        - These are clauses that make complete sence on their own. 
    2. **Dependent clause**: subordinate clause
        - These are the clauses that cannot make complete sense on their own and depend on the main clause to make their maening complete. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Conjunctions** are required to **join clauses**. 
> Eg: **coordinating conjunctions** (eg. and, for, or, yet, but, not, so, nor, etc.) and **corelative conjunction** (either, or, neither, nor, etc.)

- In a clause the minimum criteria is there should be one main clause and one subordinate clause but there can be more than one main clause and more than one subordinate clause in a clause

- **Connnecting two main clauses**
    > Eg. Ram is studing and/but Hari is playing. 
    - For connecting main clauses we use 'and' and 'but'.
- **Connecting main clause and a subordinate clause** 
    - For this, we use **subordinating conjunction**, i.e., when, before, though, although, because, etc.
    - We can also use **relative pronouns**, i.e., who, whom, whose, which, whos, that, etc.

## Coordinating Conjunctions 
Coordinating conjunctio is a word that joins two elements of equal grammatical rand or importance. They can join two verbs, adjectives, phrases, nouns and independent clauses. 

> Seeema is cooking and Ravi is serving. 
> > Here, **and** is the **coordinating conjunction**.
